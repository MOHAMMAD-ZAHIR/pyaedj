# py-ae-dj

Welcome!

## Goals

py-ae-dj is an experimental project helping developers use Python and Django
on Google App Engine. It has minimal, but all nessesary tools for setting up,
developing, testing, configuring, deploying, managining, and supporting a
typical Python App Engine application. It also shows how to develop Django
application with Google Cloud SQL, Google Cloud Datastore and other Google
Cloud APIs.

We have two versions:
* **DEPRECATED** -- Python 2.7 server with server-side templating [link] (./platform/README.md)
* **CURRENT** -- Python 3.7 API server with JavaScript responsive web app [link] (./toybox/README.md)

Good luck!
